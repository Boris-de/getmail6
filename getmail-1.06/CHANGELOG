Changes for getmail:
====================

v.1.06 15 February 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
	-changed the way getmail parses the results of the POP3 UIDL command to fix
	a problem when servers do not use the message ID as the UIDL result.

v.1.05 Not released
	
v.1.04 12 February 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
	-getmail can now change the ownership of message files delivered to a
	Maildir on a per-recipient basis for domain mailboxes if run with root
	privileges.

v.1.03.01 10 February 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
    -Fixed a small bug in output where one info message was being printed in
    'quiet' mode.

v.1.03 8 February 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
    -Added the ability to quote option values in the .getmailrc file to preserve
    leading and trailing whitespace.  Can be quoted with single or double
    quotes; they are not necessary if there is no leading or trailing
    whitespace on the option value.

v.1.02 2 February 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
    -Various small changes

v.1.01 29 January 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
    -Various small changes

v.1.00 22 January 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
    -Wrote some texinfo documentation to replace the mishmash that existed
    previously.
    -Took out the last of the (commented-out) debugging output.  I figure
    getmail is now production quality code.
    -Included the getmail startup accelerator script.
    -Whee, hit verison 1.00.  Let me know if it needs work.

v.0.99 10 January 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
    -Major bugs discovered related to using the standard ConfigParser module,
      at least for what getmail needs it to do.  So, to fix the bugs...
    -Implemented own configuration file parser.  Limitations on configuration
      file format are now obsolete; do not escape the '@' sign in email
      addresses when using the domain (multidrop) mailbox features.  Spaces are
      legal again in section titles.  Leading and trailing whitespace is
      ignored.  Comments may once again follow data lines in the configuration
      file.

v.0.98.2 10 January 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
    -Fixed the broken --rcfile / -r options.
    -Found new problems in config file format.  See updated example.getmailrc
      for changes.  Essentially, comments have to be on lines by themselves now,
      and section titles can't have spaces in them.

v.0.98 9 January 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
    -Added experimental code for handling domain mailboxes.  Feedback would
      be greatly appreciated.  See the files USAGE and ABOUT and
      example.getmailrc to configure domain mailbox support.
    -Changed some error messages.

v.0.97.x 8 January 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
    -Slightly changed creation of 'From ' mbox delimiter for overly picky
      mail clients.
    -Options to delete retrieved mail, and to only retrieve unread mail,
      can now be specified on a per-account basis in the .getmailrc file.
      The options are specified in each account section, with 'delete=value'
      and 'readall=value', where value is '1', 'true', or 'yes', or '0',
      'no', or 'false'.
    -Consequently, the commandline options only affect accounts given on
      the commandline.  Defaults are built into the script, in the
      section titled 'Defaults'.
    -Changed password entry method.

v.0.96 8 January 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
    -Fixed a bug which resulted in failure to deliver to an mbox file when
      there was no Return-Path: header in a retrieved email.
    -Fixed a bug where explicitly specifying the --dont-delete or -l options
      (even though they are the default) caused mail to be deleted from the
      POP3 server.
    -The GETMAIL environment variable is now unnecessary if your getmail
      configuration/data directory is located at $HOME/.getmail
    -Some unnecessary code removed.
    -Exit codes changed.  0 means mail retrieved, 1 means no mail, -1 means
      fatal error, and 100/101 are exits due to options --help and --dump.

v.0.95 5 January 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
    -Changed the .getmailrc configuration file format to a sectioned
      'option=value' format.  It is now much easier to read and write,
       although its a little lengthier to create.  This allows the use of
       colons and equal signs in the variables as well, which may have
       caused problems with the old format.  The old format is used for
       accounts specified on the commandline.
    -Happy 29th birthday to Shannon.

v.0.94 4 January 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
    -Added mbox delivery.
    -Added autodetection of delivery destination type; getmail will auto-
      detect Maildirs.  If a file is supplied as the destination, getmail
      assumes it is an mbox file.

v.0.93 4 January 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
    -Changed method of generating emergency save filenames to reduce
      collisions when multiple failures occur rapidly.

v.0.92 4 January 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
    -Added GETMAILOPS environment variable, where default options can be
      placed.
    -Added a --dump option for debugging purposes.
    -Added checking to ensure we're actually trying to deliver to a Maildir,
      and not an mbox or other structure.
    -Made safer; if Maildir delivery fails for any reason, getmail will
      write the message to a temporary file in the current directory.  This
      should only happen if you try to deliver to a non-existant or non-
      writable Maildir.

v.0.91 3 January 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
    -Fixed bug in option parsing for --configdir longopt.
    -Some cleanups for future options.

v.0.90 2 January 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
    -Implemented retrieval of only unread mail, with tracking via POP3 UIDL
      ID's.
    -Changed some arguments to fit above.
    -Now uses a configuration/data directory instead of just a .getmailrc file.
      Default config directory is taken from environment variable 'GETMAIL'
      if it exists.  Can be overridden by commandline option for multiple
      configurations.
    -Default .getmailrc file is '.getmailrc' in the configuration directory
      taken from the environment variable 'GETMAIL' or supplied on commandline.
      Can be overridden by commandline option for multiple setups.

v.0.71 - v.0.80

v.0.71 2 January 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
    -Fixed minor bug with POP3-escaped period handling.
    -Minor cleanups.
    -Made Freshmeat announcement.

v.0.70 1 January 2000 Charles Cazabon <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>
    -First public release.
    -Main features all verified working.  Does not keep track of new/old mail yet.
