getmail changes since version 1.11:

Version 2.0.9
23 January 2001

  -added a '--trace' option.  This will spit out copious debugging information,
  very handy for diagnosing problems via email.  Getting this output before
  involved commenting out one line in the source.
  -changes to the way the getmail class takes local user directives as
  arguments.  The previous method prevented you specifying the same re pattern
  more than once.  Thanks to Phil Smith for the initial question/bug report
  and his patience while I tracked this one down.
  -two small changes to handle timeouts and other exceptions.  Thanks to
  Stephen Morrison and Dave Seidel for bug reports on this.
  
Version 2.0.8
14 January 2001

  -Aijaz Ansari reported a bug:  if the first address found in a message
  was illegally formatted in a certain way, Python's rfc822 module could return
  None instead of a string for the address.  getmail would then throw an
  exception.  getmail now contains a workaround for this bug.

Version 2.0.6
8 January 2001

  -another typo bug in extract_recipients().  Thanks to Roger De Salis for the
  bug report.

Version 2.0.5
30 December 2000

  -fix stupid mistake in extract_recipients().  Not sure why no one reported
  this before.  Thanks to J. Boehm for the bug report.

Version 2.0.4
30 December 2000

  -add additional exception class to catch case of PPP down, etc.

Version 2.0.3
20 December 2000

  -fix bug in one error message which caused getmail to throw an exception
  if it failed to write the oldmail file.
  -added to the FAQ and documentation while I was at it.

Version 2.0.2
19 December 2000

  -fix bug where getmail would throw an exception when supplied the --help
  commandline option.  Changed behaviour of --help slightly.
  -add additional documentation.  Not 100% complete yet, but better.
  -packaging changes.  Separate files are now included for getmail.txt, 
  docs.txt, and faq.txt.
  -updated website.

Version 2.0.1

  -add "Apparently-To:" to first group of headers to parse for recipient
