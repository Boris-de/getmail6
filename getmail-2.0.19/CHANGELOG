getmail changes since version 1.11:
-----------------------------------

Version 2.0.19
18 April 2001

  -add additional exception handling for POP3 protocol errors (server bugs) and
  socket errors after connect (network errors).  Thanks to Jesper Andersen for
  the bug report.
  -add additional log message to make diagnosis of server problems easier.
  Apparently Mandrake Linux v.7.2 ships with a very broken POP3 server;
  several users sent me traces which I tracked down to gross violations of
  the POP3 protocol (RFC1939).

Version 2.0.18
20 February 2001

  -add better error output when a Maildir delivery target is not a Maildir
  -fix documentation bug regarding percent signs.  Thanks to Niall O'Higgins
  for the bug report.
  -add subclass of rfc822.AddressList to work around bug in standard library.
  Thanks to Alex Kramarox and Dan Reish for both being hit by this bug and
  informing me of it.
  -don't parse recipient addresses if no local user configurations.  Thanks
  to Alex Kramarov for reminding me about this.

Version 2.0.17 (release codename:  "Dan")
15 February 2001

  -fix typo in output of login() while printing the response to the USER 
  command.  I had "reponse".  Thanks to Dan Reish for the patch.
  -change a contraction to two words in the docstring for deliver_msg().
  Emacs apparently doesn't like apostrophes in a triple-quoted docstring if
  the apostrophe isn't on the first line.  Funny, my editor does the same
  thing :).  Again, thanks to Dan Reish.
  -add workaround for servers which violate RFC1939 in their response to the 
  LIST command.  getmail will print a warning and try to gracefully continue. 
  Dan Reish reported this; it appears to have been a temporary problem with the 
  POP3 service of a webmail site.  Please let me know if other servers trigger 
  this.
  -fix APOP.  Was misinterpreting an earlier POP3 RFC.  getmail will fall back
  to normal USER/PASS authentication if you configure it to use APOP for a
  server which does not support it.
  -clean up exception handling.
  -add "no_delivered_to" configuration directive to suppress creation of this
  header.

Version 2.0.16
11 February 2001

  -add additional exception to list to ensure no loss of email.  This is
  a brown-paper-bag bug.  It would happen if delivery failed in some
  circumstances and the server treated a dropped connection as a successfully
  completed session.  Thanks to Dan Reish for the bug report.
  -fix weird code bug -- remove incorrect exception name in two places.  Not
  enough coffee that day?  Nobody noticed (or at least reported) this one.
  Would only have come up in strange error conditions.
  -add APOP authentication.  Use configuration option "use_apop = 1" in the
  account section to enable this.  You still need to supply your password as
  normal.  getmail still defaults to normal PASS authentication.
  Sigh.  Wrote all the code for creating the appropriate secret by hand, then
  looked at poplib.py and found it does it for you.  At least my algorithm was
  identical to it.

Version 2.0.15
10 February 2001

  -make "recipient_header" a configuration option.  It defaults to the
  list of headers which was previously hardcoded.  List once for each header
  type you want to look in.
  -include semi-manual parser for extracting addresses from Received: headers.
  Thanks to Ian ? for the bug report which made me do this.
  -optimize process_msg()
  -remove obsolete "options" global
  -update documentation, FAQ, and example getmailrc file
  
Version 2.0.14
8 February 2001

  -change output to include postmaster deliveries in local deliveries count
  -ensure address is returned by mess822.getaddrlist() in extract_recipients().
  Thanks to Alex Kramarov for the bug report.

Version 2.0.13
6 February 2001

  -fix typo bug in getmail.go() which threw an exception if the POP3 server
  doesn't support the UIDL command.  Thanks to Andrew Medico for the bug
  report.

Version 2.0.12
5 February 2001

  -new method of determining local recipients.  The desired headers are all
  parsed; only if no local configuration directives match any of the
  detected email addresses is the message delivered to the postmaster
  configuration.

Version 2.0.11
1 February 2001

  -changed the getmail helper script to be more efficient.
  -began releasing an RPM of getmail in addition to the raw tarball.  The RPM
  is a noarch RPM with default paths changed to match the Linux Filesystem
  Specification.
  -changes to the way way headers are parsed for matching local recipients.
  -added to the FAQ.

Version 2.0.10
31 January 2001

  -moved the session.quit() handling code around to handle timeouts while
  exiting better.  Thanks to Stephen Morrison for the bug report.
  -added the getmail version number and '--dump' output to its bug report code.
  -moved parsing of Received: headers before To:, cc:, Resent-to:, and
  Resent-cc:.  This should improve identification of the proper local recipient
  if the final MTA is sendmail and the envelope recipient doesn't show up in
  the other headers (mailing list mail, etc).  Also switched the order of
  X-Envelope-To: and Apparently-To:.  I wish sendmail would just go away.
  -includes newer version 1.12 of Timothy O'Malley's timeoutsocket.py.
  Previously included 1.10, which could cause problems under Python 2.0 in
  some circumstances, but did not apparently affect getmail.

Version 2.0.9
23 January 2001

  -added a '--trace' option.  This will spit out copious debugging information,
  very handy for diagnosing problems via email.  Getting this output before
  involved commenting out one line in the source.
  -changes to the way the getmail class takes local user directives as
  arguments.  The previous method prevented you specifying the same re pattern
  more than once.  Thanks to Phil Smith for the initial question/bug report
  and his patience while I tracked this one down.
  -two small changes to handle timeouts and other exceptions.  Thanks to
  Stephen Morrison and Dave Seidel for bug reports on this.
  
Version 2.0.8
14 January 2001

  -Aijaz Ansari reported a bug:  if the first address found in a message
  was illegally formatted in a certain way, Python's rfc822 module could return
  None instead of a string for the address.  getmail would then throw an
  exception.  getmail now contains a workaround for this bug.

Version 2.0.6
8 January 2001

  -another typo bug in extract_recipients().  Thanks to Roger De Salis for the
  bug report.

Version 2.0.5
30 December 2000

  -fix stupid mistake in extract_recipients().  Not sure why no one reported
  this before.  Thanks to J. Boehm for the bug report.

Version 2.0.4
30 December 2000

  -add additional exception class to catch case of PPP down, etc.

Version 2.0.3
20 December 2000

  -fix bug in one error message which caused getmail to throw an exception
  if it failed to write the oldmail file.
  -added to the FAQ and documentation while I was at it.

Version 2.0.2
19 December 2000

  -fix bug where getmail would throw an exception when supplied the --help
  commandline option.  Changed behaviour of --help slightly.
  -add additional documentation.  Not 100% complete yet, but better.
  -packaging changes.  Separate files are now included for getmail.txt, 
  docs.txt, and faq.txt.
  -updated website.

Version 2.0.1
18 December 2000

  -add "Apparently-To:" to first group of headers to parse for recipient
  addresses, to better handle mailing list traffic and bcc with some MTAs.
  -packaging changes.

Version 2.0
16 December 2000

  -complete rewrite, plus rewrite of ConfParser module
