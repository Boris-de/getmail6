Known bugs:
===========

Please report bugs to me at <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>.

-Can't have commas in usernames or maildir names.  Commas are used as
  delimiters in the argument format.
-Can't have # symbols in usernames, maildirnames, or passwords in the configfile.
  This is because it is used as a comment delimiter.

-Other bugs?  Probably.
