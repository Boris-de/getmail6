  About getmail
  
   getmail is intended as a simple replacement for 'fetchmail', for those
   people who don't need its various and sundry configuration options,
   complexities, and bugs. It retrieves mail from one or more POP3
   servers for one or more email accounts, and reliably delivers into a
   Maildir specified on a per-account basis.
   
  Installing getmail
  
   getmail is a Python script. Ensure the Python interpreter is installed
   on your machine (see www.python.org for details). Put the script
   somewhere with executable permissions (probably 0755). If you like,
   make a symbolic link named 'getmail' to the actual script
   'getmail.py'.
   
  Using getmail
  
   Run without arguments for help.
   To retrieve mail for accounts, run with arguments as follows:
   getmail.py [options] user1@mailhost1[:port],maildir1[,password1] user2
   @mailhost2[:port],maildir2[,password2]
   For example, to retrieve mail for account 'joe' on mailhost
   'mail.isp.com', running on port 8110, and deliver that mail into the
   maildir 'Maildir' in your home directory, run as follows:
   getmail.py [options] joe@mail.isp.com:8110,$HOME/Maildir,password
   If you omit the final ',password', getmail will prompt you for your
   password. You may omit the :port portion if the server runs on the
   standard POP3 port (110).
   You can retrieve mail for multiple accounts at once, delivering to
   different maildirs, by specifying multiple arguments:
   getmail.py [options] user1@mailhost1.net:8110,$HOME/Maildir,password u
   ser2@mailhost2.com,$HOME/Mail/user2Maildir
   Note in this case, mailhost2 is on the standard POP3 port and the user
   will be prompted only for user2's password.
