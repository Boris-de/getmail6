  What is getmail?
  
   getmail is a POP3 mail retriever, with support for both ordinary and
   domain (or multidrop) POP3 mailboxes. It is written in Python, and
   licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.
   
  How can I get support for getmail?
  
   getmail is Free Software. As such, it comes with no warranty. However,
   I will do my best to support getmail on a voluntary basis.
   If you have questions about getmail, the first step is to read the
   documentation, and the remainder of the Frequently Asked Questions. If
   your question isn't answered there, please subscribe to the mailing
   list by sending a blank email to <getmail-subscribe @
   discworld.dnsalias.org>. If you post your question there, I will see
   it. As an additional bonus, your question may be answered by another
   member of the list.
   
  I think I found a bug! How do I report it?
  
   Ideally, you should join the mailing list. Send your bug report there.
   You should include the following information:
     * getmail version
     * Python version
     * any error message which getmail displayed
     * the output from running getmail with your normal options plus
       "--dump"
     * if your problem is getmail not determining the proper local
       recipient, please include the output of running getmail with your
       normal options plus "--trace", showing the retrieval of one
       problematic message.
       
   If you cannot sign up for the mailing list, send the report to me
   directly.
   
  What is a "domain mailbox"?
  
   A domain (or multidrop) mailbox is a POP3 mailbox which holds mail for
   all users in a given domain. Normal mailboxes contain mail for a
   single user (like "jason@myisp.co.uk"'); some Internet Service
   Providers which provide webhosting or other services will provide a
   POP3 mailbox which contains mail for all addresses in a given domain
   (like "service@smallcompany.net" and "sales@smallcompany.net").
   getmail provides a method of retrieving mail from a domain mailbox and
   distributing it among the various users automatically.
   
  Do I have to run sendmail or another MTA to use getmail?
  
   No. getmail delivers directly to Maildirs or mboxes, and does not
   inject mail via SMTP, so no MTA is necessary.
   P.S. If you're currently running sendmail, consider switching to qmail
   if you need a full MTA, or nullmailer if you relay all your mail
   through your ISP's smarthost. Both of them are better and more secure
   than sendmail.
   
  I've configured getmail to deliver to my Maildir, but it won't do it. Why?
  
   Double-check your getmailrc file. Starting with version 2.0, Maildir
   specifications must include a trailing slash. For example,
   postmaster = /home/adam/Maildir
   is incorrect. The correct method is:
   postmaster = /home/adam/Maildir/
   
  getmail says it can't find my default config file (getmailrc) file, but I've
  checked everything and it's fine. What's wrong?
  
   What version of Python are you running? Versions earlier than 1.5.2
   can cause this problem. Upgrade to Python 1.5.2 or later.
   
  I've got a simple POP3 account. Do I need "local=..." configuration
  variables?
  
   No, you don't need them. They might be useful to you if the MTA on the
   POP3 server supports extension addresses (i.e. qmail). But in general,
   you will only need a "postmaster=..." configuration.
   
  I've configured getmail to deliver to my mbox file, but it won't do it. Why?
  
   The problem is one or more of the following:
     * The user getmail is running as doesn't have write permission to
       the mbox file you specified.
     * The path you specified is actually a symlink to the mbox file.
       getmail refuses to deliver to an mbox if it is a symlink. Specify
       the path to the actual file instead.
     * The path you specified doesn't exist. getmail won't create an mbox
       file. `touch` the file first, to create a 0-byte file.
     * The file does not appear to be an mbox file. It has to either
       start with the five character string "From " or be a zero-length
       file. The mboxrd specification demands this.
       
  How do I make getmail deliver messages by re-injecting with SMTP?
  
   You don't. getmail doesn't do this, to prevent lost mail, mail loops,
   and bounces if getmail or your Mail Transfer Agent is misconfigured.
   getmail has native support for delivering to qmail-style Maildirs and
   mboxrd-format mbox files, and therefore you shouldn't need to
   re-inject retrieved messages. If you want to re-inject messages to run
   procmail, search freshmeat.net for "procbox"; it was written by
   getmail user Jeff Clement for this purpose.
   Another alternative, if you absolutely have to do this, is:
     * Deliver all your messages into a specific Maildir with your
       postmaster configuration directive.
     * Run getmail.
     * Run a shellscript on the Maildir which feeds each message to
       maildrop, procmail, /usr/bin/sendmail, or whatever.
       
   I will not provide support for this idea; if you're smart enough to
   anticipate and handle the possible problems, you're smart enough to
   write the script to do it.
   
  My 'net connection is via PPP/SLIP/modem, and when it's down, my cron'd
  getmail throws a "error: host not found" exception.
  
   Upgrade to the latest version of getmail to solve this problem.
   
  Does getmail rewrite mail headers when it retrieves mail?
  
   No. getmail will add a new Received: header and a new Delivered-To:
   header, but does not rewrite existing headers.
   
  Why does getmail retrieve all my messages when I've told it to only retrieve
  new mail?
  
   Your POP3 mail server is probably broken. getmail requires that the
   server support the POP3 UIDL command to uniquely identify messages. If
   the server doesn't support it, getmail cannot tell which messages it
   has already seen, and therefore retrieves all messages.
   
  How do I run getmail in "daemon" mode?
  
   Use cron to run getmail periodically if you wish. I may add native
   support for a daemon mode to getmail in the future; the complete
   rewrite for version 2.0 made allowances for this.
   
  Why did you write getmail? Why not just use fetchmail?
  
   I do not like some of the design choices which were made with
   fetchmail. getmail does things a little differently, and for my
   purposes, better. In addition, most people find getmail easier to
   configure and use than fetchmail. Perhaps most importantly, getmail
   cannot lose retrieved mail, while fetchmail (in its default
   configuration) can.
