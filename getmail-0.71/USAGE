Usage:
======

getmail is intended as a simple replacement for 'fetchmail', for those people
who don't need its various and sundry configuration options, complexities, and
bugs.  It retrieves mail from one or more POP3 servers for one or more email
accounts, and reliably delivers into a Maildir specified on a per-account
basis.

Basic usage for getmail.py:

Run without arguments for help.

To retrieve mail for accounts, run with arguments as follows:
getmail.py [options] user1@mailhost1[:port],maildir1[,password1] \
  user2@mailhost2[:port],maildir2[,password2]

For example, to retrieve mail for account 'joe' on mailhost 'mail.isp.com',
running on port 8110, and deliver that mail into the maildir 'Maildir' in
your home directory, run as follows:

getmail.py [options] joe@mail.isp.com:8110,$HOME/Maildir,password

If you omit the final ',password', getmail will prompt you for your password.
You may omit the :port portion if the server runs on the standard POP3 port
(110).

You can retrieve mail for multiple accounts at once, delivering to different
maildirs, by specifying multiple arguments:

getmail.py [options] user1@mailhost1.net:8110,$HOME/Maildir,password \
  user2@mailhost2.com,$HOME/Mail/user2Maildir

Note in this case, mailhost2 is on the standard POP3 port and the user
will be prompted only for user2's password.

These arguments can also be placed in a configfile (suggested:
$HOME/.getmailrc), one per line, with '#' indicating the start of comments.
This file can be specified on the commandline with the -c or --config
options, or in an environment variable (default:  GETMAILRC).  Specifying
a config file on the commandline overrides the environment variable.

Options that getmail currently recognizes are:

  -a or --all                retrieve all messages.
    This is the default.

  -u or --new                retrieve unread messages.
    This is not yet supported.

  -d or --delete             delete mail after retrieving.

  -l or --dont-delete        leave mail on server after retrieving.
    This is the default.

  -v or --verbose            output more information.
    Without this, getmail will be fairly quiet.

  -h or --help               basic usage information.

  -c or --config <file>      read account information from <file>
    This overrides configfile from %s environment variable
