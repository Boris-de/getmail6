Known bugs:
===========

Please report bugs to me at <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>.  If getmail
behaves contrary to what you expect, invoke it again with the same options,
plus the --dump option and send the output to me.

-Can't have commas in usernames or destination Maildir/mbox names specified on
  the commandline.  Commas are used as delimiters in the argument format.
  If you must have commas in usernames or destination names, use a .getmailrc
  file.

-Can't have # symbols in usernames, maildirnames, or passwords in the configfile.
  This is because it is used as a comment delimiter.

-Specifying --new and --delete will not delete messages on the server which
  getmail has previously retrieved.  When --new is specified, getmail skips to
  the next message as soon as it sees a message it has previously downloaded.
  I can change this, if anyone has a sensible behaviour pattern to suggest.
  The workaround to delete previously downloaded messages is to invoke getmail
  with the --all and --delete options once; you can then revert to --new
  and --delete.

-If the user specifies a non-existent or non-wriatable maildir, or a file/
  directory which is not a maildir, delivery fails.  getmail will save the
  mail in a temporary file in the current directory, and tell you about it.

-Other bugs?  Possibly.  Report them and I'll try to fix them.
