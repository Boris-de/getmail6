  What is getmail?
  
   getmail is a POP3 mail retriever, with support for both ordinary and
   domain (or multidrop) POP3 mailboxes. It is written in Python, and
   licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.
   
  How can I get support for getmail?
  
   getmail is Free Software. As such, it comes with no warranty. However,
   I will do my best to support getmail on a voluntary basis.
   If you have questions about getmail, the first step is to read the
   documentation, and the remainder of the Frequently Asked Questions. If
   your question isn't answered there, please subscribe to the mailing
   list by sending a blank email to <getmail-subscribe @

   it. As an additional bonus, your question may be answered by another

  What is a "domain mailbox"?
  
   A domain (or multidrop) mailbox is a POP3 mailbox which holds mail for
   all users in a given domain. Normal mailboxes contain mail for a
   single user (like "jason@myisp.co.uk"'); some Internet Service
   Providers which provide webhosting or other services will provide a
   POP3 mailbox which contains mail for all addresses in a given domain
   (like "service@smallcompany.net" and "sales@smallcompany.net").
   getmail provides a method of retrieving mail from a domain mailbox and
   distributing it among the various users automatically.
   
  Do I have to run sendmail or another MTA to use getmail?
  
   No. getmail delivers directly to Maildirs or mboxes, and does not
   inject mail via SMTP, so no MTA is necessary.
   P.S. If you're currently running sendmail, consider switching to qmail
   if you need a full MTA, or nullmailer if you relay all your mail
   through your ISP's smarthost. Both of them are better and more secure
   than sendmail.
   
  I've configured getmail to deliver to my Maildir, but it won't do it. Why?
  
   Double-check your getmailrc file. Starting with version 2.0, Maildir
   specifications must include a trailing slash. For example,
   postmaster = /home/adam/Maildir
   is incorrect. The correct method is:
   postmaster = /home/adam/Maildir/
   
  I've configured getmail to deliver to my mbox file, but it won't do it. Why?
  
   The problem is one or more of the following:
     * The user getmail is running as doesn't have write permission to
       the mbox file you specified.
     * The path you specified is actually a symlink to the mbox file.
       getmail refuses to deliver to an mbox if it is a symlink. Specify
       the path to the actual file instead.
     * The path you specified doesn't exist. getmail won't create an mbox
       file. `touch` the file first, to create a 0-byte file.
     * The file does not appear to be an mbox file. It has to either
       start with the five character "From " or be a zero-length file.
       The mbox specification demands this.
       
  How do I make getmail deliver messages by re-injecting with SMTP?
  
   You don't. getmail doesn't do this, to prevent mail loops and bounces
   if getmail or your Mail Transfer Agent is misconfigured.
   getmail has native support for delivering to qmail-style Maildirs and
   mboxrd-format mbox files, and therefore you shouldn't need to
   re-inject retrieved messages. If you want to re-inject messages to run
   procmail, search freshmeat.net for "procbox"; it was written by
   getmail user Jeff Clement for this purpose.
   
  Does getmail rewrite mail headers when it retrieves mail?
  
   No. getmail will add a new Received: header and a new Delivered-To:
   header, but does not rewrite existing headers.
   
  Why does getmail retrieve all my messages when I've told it to only retrieve
  new mail?
  
   Your POP3 mail server is probably broken. getmail requires that the
   server support the POP3 UIDL command to uniquely identify messages. If
   the server doesn't support it, getmail cannot tell which messages it
   has already seen, and therefore retrieves all messages.
   
  How do I run getmail in "daemon" mode?
  
   Use cron to run getmail periodically if you wish. I may add native
   support for a daemon mode to getmail in the future; the complete
   rewrite for version 2.0 made allowances for this.
