getmail changes since version 1.11:

Version 2.0.13
6 February 2001

  -fix typo bug in getmail.go() which threw an exception if the POP3 server
  doesn't support the UIDL command.  Thanks to Andrew Medico for the bug
  report.

Version 2.0.12
5 February 2001

  -new method of determining local recipients.  The desired headers are all
  parsed; only if no local configuration directives match any of the
  detected email addresses is the message delivered to the postmaster
  configuration.

Version 2.0.11
1 February 2001

  -changed the getmail helper script to be more efficient.
  -began releasing an RPM of getmail in addition to the raw tarball.  The RPM
  is a noarch RPM with default paths changed to match the Linux Filesystem
  Specification.
  -changes to the way way headers are parsed for matching local recipients.
  -added to the FAQ.

Version 2.0.10
31 January 2001

  -moved the session.quit() handling code around to handle timeouts while
  exiting better.  Thanks to Stephen Morrison for the bug report.
  -added the getmail version number and '--dump' output to its bug report code.
  -moved parsing of Received: headers before To:, cc:, Resent-to:, and
  Resent-cc:.  This should improve identification of the proper local recipient
  if the final MTA is sendmail and the envelope recipient doesn't show up in
  the other headers (mailing list mail, etc).  Also switched the order of
  X-Envelope-To: and Apparently-To:.  I wish sendmail would just go away.
  -includes newer version 1.12 of Timothy O'Malley's timeoutsocket.py.
  Previously included 1.10, which could cause problems under Python 2.0 in
  some circumstances, but did not apparently affect getmail.

Version 2.0.9
23 January 2001

  -added a '--trace' option.  This will spit out copious debugging information,
  very handy for diagnosing problems via email.  Getting this output before
  involved commenting out one line in the source.
  -changes to the way the getmail class takes local user directives as
  arguments.  The previous method prevented you specifying the same re pattern
  more than once.  Thanks to Phil Smith for the initial question/bug report
  and his patience while I tracked this one down.
  -two small changes to handle timeouts and other exceptions.  Thanks to
  Stephen Morrison and Dave Seidel for bug reports on this.
  
Version 2.0.8
14 January 2001

  -Aijaz Ansari reported a bug:  if the first address found in a message
  was illegally formatted in a certain way, Python's rfc822 module could return
  None instead of a string for the address.  getmail would then throw an
  exception.  getmail now contains a workaround for this bug.

Version 2.0.6
8 January 2001

  -another typo bug in extract_recipients().  Thanks to Roger De Salis for the
  bug report.

Version 2.0.5
30 December 2000

  -fix stupid mistake in extract_recipients().  Not sure why no one reported
  this before.  Thanks to J. Boehm for the bug report.

Version 2.0.4
30 December 2000

  -add additional exception class to catch case of PPP down, etc.

Version 2.0.3
20 December 2000

  -fix bug in one error message which caused getmail to throw an exception
  if it failed to write the oldmail file.
  -added to the FAQ and documentation while I was at it.

Version 2.0.2
19 December 2000

  -fix bug where getmail would throw an exception when supplied the --help
  commandline option.  Changed behaviour of --help slightly.
  -add additional documentation.  Not 100% complete yet, but better.
  -packaging changes.  Separate files are now included for getmail.txt, 
  docs.txt, and faq.txt.
  -updated website.

Version 2.0.1
18 December 2000

  -add "Apparently-To:" to first group of headers to parse for recipient
  addresses, to better handle mailing list traffic and bcc with some MTAs.
  -packaging changes.

16 December 2000

  -complete rewrite, plus rewrite of ConfParser module
