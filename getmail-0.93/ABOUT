  About getmail
  
   getmail is intended as a simple replacement for 'fetchmail', for those
   people who don't need its various and sundry configuration options,
   complexities, and bugs. It retrieves mail from one or more POP3
   servers for one or more email accounts, and reliably delivers into a
   Maildir specified on a per-account basis.
   
  Installing getmail
  
   getmail is a Python script. Ensure the Python interpreter is installed
   on your machine (see www.python.org for details). Put the script
   somewhere with executable permissions (probably 0755). If you like,
   make a symbolic link named 'getmail' to the actual script
   'getmail.py'.
   
  Using getmail
  
   Run without arguments for help.
   
    Retrieving mail on a one-time basis
    
   To retrieve mail for accounts on a one-time basis, run with arguments
   as follows:
   getmail.py [options] user1@mailhost1[:port],maildir1[,password1] user2
   @mailhost2[:port],maildir2[,password2]
   
   For example, to retrieve mail for account 'joe' on mailhost
   'mail.isp.com', running on port 8110, and deliver that mail into the
   maildir 'Maildir' in your home directory, run as follows:
   getmail.py [options] joe@mail.isp.com:8110,$HOME/Maildir,password
   
   If you omit the final ',password', getmail will prompt you for your
   password. You may omit the :port portion if the server runs on the
   standard POP3 port (110).
   
   You can retrieve mail for multiple accounts at once, delivering to
   different maildirs, by specifying multiple arguments:
   getmail.py [options] user1@mailhost1.net:8110,$HOME/Maildir,password u
   ser2@mailhost2.com,$HOME/Mail/user2Maildir
   
   Note in this case, mailhost2 is on the standard POP3 port and the user
   will be prompted only for user2's password.
   
    Retrieving mail on a regular basis
    
   To use getmail to retrieve from the same accounts on a regular basis,
   and to be able to retrieve only mail messages which getmail has not
   previously retrieved, set up getmail as follows:
     * Create a .getmail/ directory in your home directory.
     * Create the environment variable GETMAIL, containing the path to
       the above directory. You can automate this in your logon by
       putting
       export GETMAIL=$HOME/.getmail
       in your .bash_profile or .bashrc file if you use the bash shell.
     * Create a file .getmailrc in the above directory. In it, place one
       line for each mail account you wish to retrieve mail for. The line
       is in this format:
       username@popmailhost[:port],maildir[,password]
       For example, to retrieve mail for account 'joe' on mailhost
       'popmail.isp.com' on the default POP3 port (110), and deliver the
       mail into a maildir in joe's home directory named 'Maildir', with
       password 'poppass', enter the following:
       joe@popmail.isp.com,/home/joe/Maildir,poppass
     * Run getmail with no options to retrieve all mail for joe. Use
       option -n or --new for only unread mail. Use option -v or
       --verbose to see what's going on.
