Yet to be done:
===============

-Write some more documentation.  A real man page, and some better user
  documentation.  Possibly a good, solid overview document for first timers
  and technophiles who don't like long documentation.

-Allow delivery to mbox files, and possibly mh folders.

-Possibly allow delivery to various maildirs based on headers in received
  messages, to allow the use of mailbox-per-domain.  I believe 'fetchmail'
  calls this 'multidrop'.

-Distribute a Makefile with an 'install' target with the program.  This will
  become a higher priority once there is a proper manpage, etc to install.
