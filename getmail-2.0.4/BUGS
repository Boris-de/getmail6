Fixed Bugs Since version 2.0:
=============================

v.2.0.3:
--------

-fixed a problem where getmail would throw an exception while attempting to
  log an error after failing to write the "oldmail" file.  Reported by
  Grt Jeroen.

v.2.0.2:
--------

-changed handling of --help option.  Previously, it would fail if it was the
  only option given.
  
v.2.0.1:
--------

-added "Apparently-To:" to the initial group of headers to scan for local
  recipients.  Not having it there would cause problems with receiving
  bcc'd mail if the MTA uses Apparently-To: instead of Delivered-To: .
  Reported by Tony Puglisi.
