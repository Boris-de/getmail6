Usage:
======

getmail is intended as a simple replacement for 'fetchmail', for those people
who don't need its various and sundry configuration options, complexities, and
bugs.  It retrieves mail from one or more POP3 servers for one or more email
accounts, and reliably delivers into a Maildir specified on a per-account
basis.  It can now also deliver into mbox files, although this should not
be attempted over NFS.

Bugs, questions, feature requests, and comments should be directed to me

In a nutshell:
--------------

1.  Ensure Python v.1.5.2 is installed.  See http://www.python.org/ for details.
	Note that RedHat GNU/Linux 6.0 ships with v.1.5.1, which will fail.

2.  Install the script 'getmail.py' somewhere with executable permissions (0755).

3.  Optionally set up a symbolic link named 'getmail' pointing to the script.

4.  Create a .getmail/ directory in your home directory.

5.  Create a file .getmailrc in the above directory.  This file has a simple
syntax, similar to a standard MS-Windows .ini file.  In it, place one section
for each mail account you wish to retrieve mail for.  The section is in this
format:

	[identifier]				# Whatever you like, just make them unique
	account=username			# Required, your POP3 account name
	host=popmailhost			# Required, the POP3 mailhost
	port=portnum				# Optional, defaults to standard POP3 port (110)
	password=poppass			# Optional, getmail will prompt for passwords
	destination=path			# Required, path to destination Maildir or mbox

'destination' can be either a Maildir or an mbox file.  getmail auto-detects
Maildirs, and assumes regular files are mboxes.

See the example.getmailrc file for more details.

6.  Run getmail with no options to retrieve all mail for accounts in .getmailrc.
Use option -n or --new for only unread mail.  Use option -v or --verbose to
see what's going on.


Basic usage for getmail.py:
---------------------------

Run without arguments for help.

To retrieve mail for accounts on a one-time basis, you can specify the
accounts as arguments on the commandline as follows:
getmail.py [options] user1@mailhost1[:port],destination1[,password1] \
  user2@mailhost2[:port],destination2[,password2]

For example, to retrieve mail for account 'joe' on mailhost 'mail.isp.com',
running on port 8110, and deliver that mail into the maildir 'Maildir' in
your home directory, run as follows:

getmail.py [options] joe@mail.isp.com:8110,$HOME/Maildir,password

If you omit the final ',password', getmail will prompt you for your password.
You may omit the :port portion if the server runs on the standard POP3 port
(110).

You can retrieve mail for multiple accounts at once, delivering to different
destinations, by specifying multiple arguments:

getmail.py [options] user1@mailhost1.net:8110,$HOME/Maildir,password \
  user2@mailhost2.com,$HOME/inbox

Note in this case, mailhost2 is on the standard POP3 port and the user
will be prompted only for user2's password.

These arguments can also be placed in a configfile (suggested:
$HOME/.getmail/.getmailrc).  See above (or the example.getmailrc file included)
for its format.  This file can be specified on the commandline with
the -r or --rcfile options.  It defaults to '.getmailrc' in a directory taken
from the environment variable 'GETMAIL', if it exists.  If the environment
variable does not exist, it will try a directory called .getmail in your
home directory.

Specifying a config file on the commandline overrides the environment variable.
An alternate configuration directory can also be specified on the commandline.
The default .getmailrc file can be skipped by supplying the --ignoreconfig or -i
option.

You can specify your own defaults by setting the environment variable
'GETMAILOPTS' with the options you like.  For instance, setting it to
"--verbose --new" will enable these two options by default.  These types of
default options can be overridden on the commandline.

Options that getmail currently recognizes are:

  -a or --all                retrieve all messages.
    This is the default.

  -u or --new                retrieve only unread messages.

  -d or --delete             delete mail after retrieving.

  -l or --dont-delete        leave mail on server after retrieving.
    This is the default.

  -v or --verbose            output more information.
    Without this, getmail will be fairly quiet.

  -h or --help               basic usage information.

  -i or --ignoreconfig       Don't read the default .getmailrc file.

  -r or --rcfile <file>      read account information from <file>
    This overrides the default configfile.  The default is '.getmailrc' in
    the directory specified below.

  -c or --configdir <dir>    Store data in <dir> instead of the default, which
    is taken from the environment variable 'GETMAIL' if it exists.

  --dump                     Output debugging information on your usage.  If
    you have problems with getmail, invoke it with the options you normally
    use, plus --dump and send the output to me at <getmail@discworld.dyndns.org>.
