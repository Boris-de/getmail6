                                1 About getmail
                                       
   getmail is intended as a simple replacement for fetchmail, for those
   people who don't need its various and sundry configuration options,
   complexities, and bugs. It retrieves mail from one or more POP3
   servers for one or more email accounts, and reliably delivers into a
   `Maildir' specified on a per-account basis. It can now also deliver
   into `mbox' files, although this should not be attempted over NFS.

                               2 The getmail FAQ
                                       
   There is now a FAQ available about getmail. Read it here.
   
                                3 Using getmail
                                       
3.1 Installing getmail

   getmail is a Python script. Ensure the Python interpreter is installed
   (version 1.5.1 or higher is recommended; at the time of this writing,
   the current version was 1.5.2. See www.python.org for details). Put
   the script somewhere with executable permissions (probably 0755). A
   simpler Python script which invokes the main getmail script can be
   used to reduce startup time:
#!/usr/bin/python
import getmail
getmail.main ()

   This allows the Python interpreter to cache the contents of the
   getmail script in a `.pyc' file. Python will not write these `.pyc'
   files for a script invoked on the commandline. The rest of this file
   assumes you have a getmail file which invokes getmail.py. If you don't
   want this, you can make it a symbolic link, or invoke getmail as
   getmail.py, or rename the main script.
   
3.2 Running getmail

   Run getmail with the `-h' or `--help' options for help.
   
  3.2.1 Retrieving mail on a one-time basis
  
   To retrieve mail for accounts on a one-time basis, run with arguments
   as follows:
getmail [options] user1@mailhost1[:port],destination1[,password1] user2@mailhos
t2[:port],destination2[,password2]

   For example, to retrieve mail for account `joe' on mailhost
   `mail.isp.com', running on port 8110, and deliver that mail into the
   Maildir `Maildir' in your home directory, run as follows:
getmail.py [options] joe@mail.isp.com:8110,$HOME/Maildir,password

   `destination' can be either a `Maildir' or an `mbox' file. getmail
   auto-detects `Maildir's, and assumes regular files are `mbox' files.
   
   If you omit the final `,password', getmail will prompt you for your
   password. You may omit the `:port' portion if the server runs on the
   standard POP3 port (110).
   
   You can retrieve mail for multiple accounts at once, delivering to
   different maildirs, by specifying multiple arguments:
getmail.py [options] user1@mailhost1.net:8110,$HOME/Maildir,password user2@mail
host2.com,$HOME/user2mbox

   Note in this case, `mailhost2' is on the standard POP3 port and the
   user will be prompted only for user2's password.
   
  3.2.2 Retrieving mail on a regular basis
  
   To use getmail to retrieve from the same accounts on a regular basis,
   and to be able to retrieve only mail messages which getmail has not
   previously retrieved, set up getmail as follows:
    1. Create a `.getmail/' directory in your home directory. If you want
       to call it something else or have it in a different location, set
       the environment variable `GETMAIL' to be the location of the
       directory.
    2. Create a file `.getmailrc' in the above directory. This file is
       similar in format to an MS-Windows `.ini' file. In it, place one
       section for each mail account you wish to retrieve mail for. The
       section is in this format:
[identifier]
account=username
host=popmailhost
port=port
password=password
destination=destinationpath
delete=value
readall=value
       The options can be specified in any order. Blank lines are
       ignored, as is anything after a `#' symbol. The meaning of the
       individual options in each section are as follows:
          + `identifier' is not currently used by getmail. Identifiers
            must be unique, and should be meaningful to you.
          + `account' is your POP3 account name.
          + `host' is the fully-qualified domain name of the POP3 server
            (e.g. `mailhost.isp.com'.
          + `port' is optional and defaults to the standard POP3 port
            (110). @item{password} is optional. If not supplied, getmail
            will prompt for passwords.
          + `destination' is the path to the destination `Maildir' or
            `mbox' file.
          + `delete' is optional, and controls whether getmail deletes
            the mail from the POP3 server after retrieving it. Valid
            values include `yes' and `no'. `delete' defaults to `no'.
          + `readall' is optional, and controls whether getmail retrieves
            all mail, or only unread mail for that account. Valid values
            include `yes' and `no'. `readall' defaults to 'yes'.
       See the included example.getmailrc file for more details.
    3. Run getmail with no options to retrieve all mail for accounts
       specified in the .getmailrc file. Use option `-n' or `--new' for
       only unread mail. Use option `-v' or `--verbose' to see what's
       going on.
    4. You can specify personal default options in the environment
       variable `GETMAILOPTS'. To make getmail always be verbose, and
       always delete retrieved mail from the server, set it to something
       like `--verbose --delete'. Again, you can set this every time you
       login in your `.bash_profile' or `.bashrc' file if you use the
       bash shell.
       
  3.2.3 Commandline Options for getmail
  
   To be added at a later date.
   
                        4 Support for Domain Mailboxes
                                       
   I have added experimental support for domain (multidrop) mailboxes. A
   domain mailbox is a POP3 mailbox which receives mail for multiple
   users. For example, all mail for anyone at `mycompany.com' might be
   delivered to a single POP3 mailbox named `mycompany@isp.com'.
   
   getmail can be configured to retrieve mail from a domain mailbox, and
   deliver each message separately, to the user it was originally
   addressed to. This type of operation is not supported in a standard
   way by the majority of the email infrastructure, so the support is
   experimental for now. I would appreciate feedback on how this works
   for you if you use it. Feedback to date has been very positive, so
   don't let its experimental status deter you.
   
   getmail tries to determine who each message was originally intended
   for by looking at the message headers. If the first valid header is a
   qmail-style `Delivered-To:' header, it will use that as the recipient.
   If that header does not exist, it will look for recipients in
   `Resent-To:', `Resent-cc:', and `Resent-bcc:' headers. If none of
   those headers exist, it will look for recipients in `To:', `cc:', and
   `bcc:' headers.
   
   getmail compares the recipients it finds against email addresses
   supplied in the `.getmailrc' configuration file. For each matching
   address it finds, getmail delivers a copy of that message to a
   destination `Maildir' or `mbox' file specified for that address. If it
   finds no matches, it delivers the message to a default destination,
   which should be the postmaster or other person responsible for sorting
   out email issues in that domain.
   
   Note that the configuration file parser was completely rewritten for
   version 0.99, so that it removes most of the restrictions that were
   previously present.
   
   The configuration file section for a domain mailbox should look like
   this:
[Section title]
type=domainbox
account=pop3username
host=pophost.domain
password=pop_password
destination=/path/to/default_delivery_destination
delete=(yes|no)
readall=(yes|no)
email@address=/path/to/destination
email@address2=/path/to/destination2
[...]

   Some examples of the `email=destination' lines are:
joe@smallcompany.com=/home/joe/Maildir
info@smallcompany.com=/home/paula/inbox

   See the file `example.getmailrc' for more details about configuration
   files.
   
   More details are available in the file `USAGE'.
