Yet to be done:
===============

-Possibly allow delivery to mh folders.

-Distribute a Makefile with an 'install' target with the program.  This will
  become a higher priority once there is a proper manpage, etc to install.

Done:
=====

[Added in v.0.94]  Allow delivery to mbox files.
[Added in v.0.98]  Experimental support for domain (multidrop) mailboxes.
[Added in v.0.99]  Wrote a new parser for the .getmailrc configuration files to
                    allow more flexible usernames and domain names to be
                    handled.
