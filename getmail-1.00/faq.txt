   These are a few of the questions I get asked about installing,
   configuring, and using getmail.
   
  What is getmail?
  
   getmail is a POP3 mail retriever program, intended as a simple
   replacement for 'fetchmail'. It is Copyright (C) 2000 by its author,
   Charles Cazabon, and licensed under the GNU General Public License
   version 2.
   
  What are getmail's features?
  
     * getmail is free software, licensed under the GNU General Public
       License version 2.
     * written in Python.
     * Retrieves mail from POP3 servers.
     * Features reliable Maildir delivery and mbox delivery.
     * Does not do delivery by re-injecting through SMTP, and therefore
       does not require an SMTP server.
     * Has support for domain (multidrop) mailboxes, where delivery
       destinations is controlled by the contents of the headers of
       retrieved messages.
     * Is easy to configure for repeated retrieval from the same mail
       accounts.
     * Can also be used in a one-off manner to retrieve from accounts
       specified on the commandline.
     * Can retrieve from an unlimited number of accounts and POP3
       servers, with delivery destinations specified on a per-account
       basis for normal mail accounts, or finer control for domain
       (multidrop) mail accounts.
       
  Where can I get it?
  
   The getmail homepage is at
   http://www.qcc.sk.ca/~charlesc/software/getmail/
   
  How do I install and use getmail?
  
   It's easy:
    1. Make sure that the Python interpreter is installed. See
       www.python.org for details.
    2. Download getmail from its homepage.
    3. Extract the contents of the tar file (e.g. tar xzf
       getmail-version.tar.gz).
    4. Copy getmail.py to somewhere in your path and make it executable
       (e.g. chmod 755 getmail.py).
    5. Create a .getmail directory in your home directory.
    6. Create a .getmailrc file in that directory. See the included files
       example.getmailrc and USAGE for its syntax.
    7. Run getmail.
       
  Is it safe to run more than one getmail at once?
  
   Short answer: yes, mostly.
   Long answer: there is one case where multiple getmail instances can
   collide and cause problems. If two or more instances are both
   retrieving mail from the same POP3 account on the same server, they
   can collide when writing to the oldmail file. However, as long as each
   instance of getmail has a different set of accounts to retrieve from,
   all is fine.
   
  Does getmail need special (root) privileges to run?
  
   No. getmail only has to have write access to the destinations
   (Maildirs or mbox files) that it tries to deliver to. This can be done
   with group-writable permissions rather than running getmail as root.
   
  Can getmail retrieve mail from an IMAP server?
  
   No. Maybe in the future.
   
  Can getmail deliver by re-injecting messages via SMTP like 'fetchmail'?
  
   No. Maybe in the future.
   But why do you want getmail to do this? If it's to take advantage of
   qmail-style extension addresses for delivery into different Maildirs,
   just use a domain-mailbox setup, with multiple destinations:
   [My mailbox]
   type=domainbox
   account = popusername
   host = mailhost.isp.net
   password = poppass
   destination = /home/username/Maildir # default Maildir
   popusername-extension1@isp.net = /home/username/Mail/list1
   popusername-extension2@isp.net = /home/username/Mail/list2
   
  I have a question about getmail that isn't answered here...
  
   Have you read the documentation, such as it is?
   Have you looked at the example.getmailrc file?
   Then write to me, so you can get help, and so I can include your
   question in this FAQ.
   Additional questions about getmail should be sent to me at
